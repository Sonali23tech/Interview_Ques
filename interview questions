Throttling (not trolling) is a system design technique used to limit 
how many requests or actions are allowed in a given time period. It protects systems from overload and abuse.

Authentication v/s authorisation

- who i m in authentication
- what all resource i can access in authorisation.

JWT- JSON WEB TOKEN
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a secure way to send information between a client and a server. 
It is mainly used in web applications and APIs to verify users and prevent unauthorized access.
A JWT is JSON data secured with a cryptographic signature.

A JWT consists of three parts separated by periods (.), which are base64url-encoded strings:

Header: The header typically consists of two parts — the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

2. Payload: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the user or other data.
Claims can be of three types: registered, public, and private claims.

3. Signature: To create the signature part, you need to take the encoded header, encoded payload,
a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, then sign that with the secret.
The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that
the message wasn’t changed along the way.
